# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Setting up the initial project structure and Memory Bank.
- Starting backend API implementation (Node.js/Express).
- Core backend API endpoints implemented (Users: register, login; Books: add, get all, get by ID, update status).
- Defining the high-level architecture for the Peer-to-Peer Book Exchange Portal.
- Initialized frontend Next.js project.
- Next focus: Frontend implementation (Next.js) or backend refinement (auth checks, error handling).
- Next focus: Basic frontend implementation (connecting to backend).

- [2025-04-12 03:17:52] - Implemented basic dashboard page (`/dashboard`) with auth checks and role-based content.
- [2025-04-12 03:02:36] - Architecture documented. Next steps involve implementing frontend components based on the design.
- [2025-04-12 03:40:01] - Implemented frontend book deletion functionality (owner only) in `BookCard.tsx` and `BookList.tsx`.
- [2025-04-12 14:08:38] - Next focus: Implement frontend session persistence, improve error handling/validation, polish UI, update README.
- [2025-04-12 14:14:41] - Implemented frontend session persistence using localStorage in `AuthContext.tsx`.
- [2025-04-12 14:23:03] - Implemented backend book cover image upload functionality using `multer` in `backend/index.js`.

- [2025-04-12 14:23:03] - Current focus: Completed backend image upload. Next steps could involve frontend integration or further backend refinement.


- [2025-04-12 14:51:07] - Completed UI polishing task (retry). Applied consistent Tailwind styling across homepage, navbar, forms (Auth, AddBook, Filter), BookCard, and layout. Fixed related JSX/TS errors.
- [2025-04-12 15:36:05] - Completed detailed file-by-file analysis. Project is functionally complete for core features and implemented bonus features (Edit/Delete, Filtering, Image Upload). Next steps: Improve validation/error handling, deploy frontend/backend, update README.
