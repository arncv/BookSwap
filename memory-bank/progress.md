    *   **Mode:** Architect
    *   **Details:** Defined high-level architecture, components, data models, API endpoints, and data flow. Documented in `memory-bank/architecture.md`.

*   [2025-04-12 03:17:38] - Task Started: Implement Basic Dashboard Page
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Created `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`. Implemented authorization check (loading, redirect), role-based content display (Owner/Seeker), and basic styling using AuthContext and Next.js router.

*   [2025-04-12 03:23:58] - Task Completed: Implement Backend Book Status Update Endpoint (`PATCH /api/books/:id/status`)
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Added basic authorization check (comparing `ownerId` with mock `x-user-id` header) to the existing status update endpoint in `backend/index.js`. Validates status input and updates `database.json`.

*   [2025-04-12 03:39:43] - Task Completed: Implement Frontend Book Deletion Button (Owner Only)
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Updated `BookCard.tsx` to add a delete button visible only to the owner, including confirmation and API call (`DELETE /api/books/:id`). Added `onDelete` callback prop. Updated `BookList.tsx` to define `handleDeleteBook` function (filtering local state) and pass it down via the `onDelete` prop.

*   [2025-04-12 03:42:39] - Task Completed: Implement Backend Book Update Endpoint (`PUT /api/books/:id`)
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Added the `PUT /api/books/:id` route handler to `backend/index.js`. It updates book details (title, author, genre, location, contact) in `database.json` after finding the book by ID and performing a basic authorization check (comparing `ownerId` with mock `x-user-id` header). It preserves `id`, `ownerId`, and `status` fields.

*   [2025-04-12 03:44:44] - Task Started: Implement Frontend Book Editing Feature (Owner Only)
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code

*   [2025-04-12 03:58:11] - Task Completed: Implement Frontend Genre Filtering UI and Logic
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Updated `FilterForm.tsx` to add genre input field, state, and update `onFilterChange`. Updated `BookList.tsx` to handle `genre` in filters state, `handleFilterChange`, and `useEffect` API call query parameters.

*   [2025-04-12 14:08:38] - Task Completed: Check Project Completion Status
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Architect/Code
    *   **Details:** Reviewed Memory Bank, checklist, backend code, and frontend components/pages. Identified remaining gaps: frontend session persistence, error handling/validation improvements, UI polish, documentation update, and optional bonus features (image upload, deployment).

*   [2025-04-12 14:14:41] - Task Completed: Implement Frontend Session Persistence
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Modified `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` to use `localStorage` to store user data on login, restore it on initial load (`useEffect`), and clear it on logout. Added `isLoading` state management during session restoration.

*   [2025-04-12 14:23:03] - Task Completed: Implement Backend Book Cover Image Upload
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Installed `multer`, created `backend/uploads` directory, configured `multer` in `backend/index.js` for image storage, added `POST /api/books/:id/cover` endpoint to handle uploads, update `database.json` with `coverImageUrl`, and serve static images. Updated GET endpoints implicitly return the URL.

*   [2025-04-12 14:50:51] - Task Completed: Apply Tailwind UI Polishing (Retry)
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Applied consistent Tailwind styling to homepage, navbar, auth form, add book form, filter form, book card, and layout based on user requirements. Fixed JSX issues in BookCard and layout.ts.

*   [2025-04-12 15:35:29] - Task Completed: Detailed Project Status Analysis (File-by-File)
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Architect

*   [2025-04-12 19:24:42] - Task Completed: Fix CSS Warning
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Mode:** Code
    *   **Details:** Removed invalid `@custom-variant dark` rule from `frontend/src/app/globals.css`. Dark mode was already correctly implemented using the `.dark` class.
    *   **Details:** Reviewed backend (index.js, package.json) and frontend (layout, context, pages, components) source code. Confirmed functional implementation of core features (Auth, Book Listing/Browsing) and bonus features (Edit/Delete, Filtering, Image Upload). Backend uses mock `x-user-id` header for owner authorization as implemented. Frontend integrates with backend APIs for all features. Key remaining gaps identified: Robust validation/error handling (FE/BE), Deployment (FE/BE), and final README update. UI polishing is basic but functional. Image upload UI is basic file input.
